                When we talk about American rap, one name is often heard : “Kanye West”. This famous rapper born in 1977 in Atlanta can nowadays be considered as a legend of his era. How huge is the influence of the rapper ? How famous is he ? That’s what we’ll see today.
                <br><br>
                First of all, we can’t denie his worldwide influence. Since the release of his first album “College Dropout” in 2002, the rapper has conquered the heart of millions of fan around the world. We can clearly see his fame through the featuring he made with legends of music such as “Daft Punk”. But also thanks to the multiple awards he has received.
                <br><br>
                Moreover, his influence isn’t only limited to rap music. Kanye West is also a successful entrepreneur and became very famous in fashion industry. Starting by collaborating with brands such as Nike or Adidas, he created his own brand “Yeezy”. Releasing very limited collection, this brand is a real success and is now a reference for sneakers and clothing fans. His career as an entrepreneur is a huge success as his musical career.
                <br><br>
                Despite all of this success, the rapper is in the middle of a lot of trouble and drama. He, for example wasn’t invited  at the last ceremony of the Grammy Awards because he threatened the new husband of his ex-wife. A lot of people don’t like him because because of his craziness. But I think it’s part of his character and we can find this part of craziness in his music and art.
                <br><br>
                In conclusion, even if Kanye West can be kind of controversial these last stimes. He is still one of the most famous of all time as he influenced a huge part of society the last decade. Go listen to his music and try to appreciate his art !

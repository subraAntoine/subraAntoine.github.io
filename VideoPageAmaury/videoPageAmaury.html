           <span class="title-article">Why is Lil Tjay the best new New York rapper?</span>

            <br><br>

            Destined to win, three words to sum up Lil Tjay’s career. On April the 2nd 2021, the young rapper dropped his second studio album: Destined 2 Win. He debuted at number 5 on the US Billboard 200 and imposes himself as a headline act in the city which never sleeps. But is he the best new rapper frow his city? Is he the New York’s king? I will show you why this newcomer has the best potential in his city.

            <br><br>

            Despite being only 21 years old, Lil Tjay already has lots of hits. A few months before his album, he dropped his best hit: Calling My Phone which started at the 3rd place on the Billboard Hot 100. This song, featuring Atlanta rapper 6lack, has become very popular on social network. Before that, he has already sent bangers like Pop Out with Chicago rapper Polo G or Zoo York with New York rappers Pop Smoke and Fivio Foreign. He also has hits when he tells sad stories inspired by his own life like F.N. We can now see that he has not only “street” hits but he is very versatile by rapping and singing, doing emotional, “street” or hype songs always with good lyrics. That is a big asset for him and shows that he is very talented.

            <br><br>

            Born in the Bronx in 2001, he grew up with his single mother and his brothers and sisters. At 15 years old, he went to a juvenile detention centre. This experience from jail made him understand several things and he started to rap at this age. All his experience from the street is also expressed through his music. He is also appreciated because he has the reputation of being a nice person. Indeed, he has collaborated with many artists like Polo G, Fivio Foreign and Pop Smoke because he is very popular in the music industry. All this experience and his features makes his music very interesting so he is very promising.


            <br><br>
            But there is a great competition in New York to be the king of the city. Indeed, the city has many rappers and has with and amazing history. Indeed, Jay-Z, 50 Cent, Biggie or Nas are legendary rappers. Today, Nicki Minaj, A$ap Rocky, Pop Smoke or Fivio Foreign are the most famous ones. But for some reason, like death, the end of a career or not dropping songs, they are now less hyped than Lil Tjay but still amazing rappers. So, to impose yourself so young is something very difficult because you have a short career and few albums at the moment.

            <br><br>
            We saw that ??? young man was very talented and ???, also very promising with his experience and his collaborations but it is very hard to become the best in a city who ??? legendary rappers. He is now one of the most hyped and he is more than a rookie. So, he is the best new New York rapper and can become a worldwide artist.
